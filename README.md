                                                ##### Test-Code #####

1. Overview:
    In this refactor, I’ve reorganized the code to make it cleaner, easier to read, and simpler to maintain or scale in the future. The core functionality is now split into smaller, focused pieces by using `services` for specific tasks, `traits` for reusable functionality, and `accessors` and `mutators` in the `Job` model to handle data transformations. This makes the code more intuitive, with clear responsibilities, so it’s easier to work with and build upon.

2. Separation of Concerns:

    Business logic was moved to dedicated services.
    Reusable logic was abstracted into traits and helpers.
    Data transformations were delegated to accessors and mutators in Eloquent models.
    Smaller, Focused Methods: Methods were broken down into smaller, single-purpose functions.

3. Cleaner Structure:

    Notification logic was extracted into a NotificationService.
    Common utilities like date/time manipulations were consolidated in helpers.
    Repository methods now focus solely on data operations.
